# Cloth with Ray Tracing

## Description

- 3D cloth simulation w/ ray tracing for shading. Written purely in java.

- I put this together over a 2 day period, under a huge time pressure. I don't intend to clean it up right now, but I may in the future.
  - The project was just my first experimentation with 3D physyics after I had spent the last year doing 2D physics projects. I have not made any efforts to optimize this, and I am aware that it is very slow.
